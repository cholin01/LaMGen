# LaMGen Model Checkpoints

The **LaMGen** model checkpoints are publicly available at [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/17198652).  

These checkpoints include:  

- **Small-molecule pretraining model**  
  Trained on the **GEOM dataset** for general molecular representation learning.  

- **Zero-shot models**  
  For **dual-target** and **triple-target** molecule generation.  

## Usage

You can download the checkpoint files from the Zenodo link above and load them in your LaMGen pipeline for further inference or fine-tuning.
